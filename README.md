# Toolbox-CAD
•	Unfortunately, I’ve lost the exact files of the design and assembled ones. Here you can just find a very simple photos of what I did during this project. As you may notice, the details and the physics are not available in these illustrations, due to the limitations of the website I used.
•	In order to view the files properly, please download them and open them on your device. Sometimes, the preview on the GitHub does not work properly.
